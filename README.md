## Singapore Travel Guide

● An application that can tell users how crowded the traffic is (to work, or home – similar to what google maps/waze does)

● Use an ML model that counts the number of vehicles from each available camera on the road journey that the user inputs (start/end points)

● Use an API that shows live traffic pictures around Singapore at data.gov.sg

● Use a threshold/heuristic of some sort to decide if the traffic is crowded or not at the moment based on the number of cars across all pictures extracted for the input journey

● Have the way to work and back home saved as a preference and display the current status so that the user does not have to input it every time
